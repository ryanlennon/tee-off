ACLTC FINAL PROJECT

The official name of my final project is TeeBox and it is an app designed to find golf courses in close proximity to a provided location and allow the user to choose a course, see course details, current weather(and 5 day forecast), and choose and book an available tee time for that day.

This project was a culmination of what I learned in 3 months of attending Anyone Can Learn to Code's programming bootcamp. I built this application from scratch using rails, ruby, angularjs, bootstrap, yahoo's weather api, and google maps api.
